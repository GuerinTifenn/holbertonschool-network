# What Happens When You Type google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter

## Project Overview
This project involves writing a detailed blog post explaining what happens from the moment you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter. This explanation will dive deep into the various layers of a typical web stack, including DNS, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancing, web servers, application servers, and databases. The purpose of this exercise is to showcase your understanding of how web infrastructure works, and it is often asked in technical interviews.

As part of this project, you will:
1. Write and publish a blog post explaining this process.
2. Create a diagram illustrating the flow of the request from the browser to the server and back.

## Requirements

### General
- The blog post can be published on platforms such as [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) or [Medium](https://www.medium.com).
- A `README.md` file must be included in the root directory of the project.

### Key Topics to Cover in the Blog Post
- **DNS Request**: How the browser looks up the IP address of the domain.
- **TCP/IP**: How the request is routed across the internet using the TCP/IP stack.
- **Firewall**: The role of firewalls in controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: How the connection is secured with SSL/TLS encryption.
- **Load Balancer**: How requests are distributed across multiple servers to balance the load.
- **Web Server**: The server that handles HTTP/HTTPS requests and returns the web page.
- **Application Server**: The server that processes the request and generates dynamic content.
- **Database**: How the application server interacts with the database to retrieve or store information.

## Tasks

### 0. What Happens When...
**Task**: Write a detailed blog post explaining the steps involved when a user types "https://www.google.com" in their browser and presses Enter.

**Key Points** to include:
- **DNS resolution**: How the domain name is translated to an IP address.
- **TCP/IP**: How the request is transmitted across the network.
- **Firewall**: How traffic passes through firewalls that protect servers.
- **HTTPS/SSL**: The encryption process that secures the communication.
- **Load Balancer**: How load balancers distribute traffic across servers.
- **Web Server**: How the web server processes the request and serves the webpage.
- **Application Server**: How dynamic content is generated by the application server.
- **Database**: How the application server interacts with the database to fulfill the request.

**Publishing**:
- Publish the blog post on **LinkedIn** or **Medium**.
- Share the URL of your blog post in the `0-blog_post` file.

**Directory**:
- `what_happens_when_your_type_google_com_in_your_browser_and_press_enter/0-blog_post`

### 1. Everything's Better with a Pretty Diagram
**Task**: Add a visual diagram to your blog post illustrating the steps covered in the previous task.

**The diagram should show**:
- DNS resolution process.
- The request hitting the server's IP address on the appropriate port.
- Encrypted traffic (HTTPS).
- Traffic passing through a firewall.
- Request distribution via a load balancer.
- The web server processing the request.
- The application server generating the content.
- The application server requesting data from the database.

**Tool**: Use a diagramming tool like [Gliffy](https://www.gliffy.com/) (free) or any other of your choice.

**Publishing**:
- Share the URL of your diagram image in the `1-what_happen_when_diagram` file.

**Directory**:
- `what_happens_when_your_type_google_com_in_your_browser_and_press_enter/1-what_happen_when_diagram`
